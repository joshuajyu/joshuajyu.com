# Hello there!

## Welcome[^1]

This is the GitHub repository for my personal webpage. For now, it's just a static webpage with a little bit of HTML and CSS, but I plan on making incremental improvements over time, and eventually turning it into a full-stack web app.

Thanks for visiting! I hope you enjoy your stay.
